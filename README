*ayumi.vim* A color scheme for vim. The color style just like my favorite
            singer ayumi-hamasiki. It also support colors defined by
            HighlightTag plugin like bandit.vim.

Description:
            The screenshot file:
            https://github.com/lorry-lee/vim-ayumi/blob/master/screenshot/ayumi.jpg

            I use HighlightTag plugin to parse c functions.

            The font is Bitstream_Vera_Sans_Mono:h10:cANSI.

            If you are writing use c you may notice I use plugin
            cSyntaxAfter to display the operators. But the color of
            _Block is written in cSyntaxAfter plugin, so I change
            cSyntaxAfter to match _Block "{}" as _Bracket because
            it's too light to see it.
